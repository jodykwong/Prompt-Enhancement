# NOTES
# ============================================================================
notes: |
  This workflow status tracks your Prompt Enhancement v1.1 development
  using the BMad Method for brownfield projects.

  You have excellent preparation already:
  - Detailed design document (DESIGN_V1.1.md)
  - Clear iteration plan (BROWNFIELD_ITERATION_GUIDE.md)
  - Structured team organization (TEAM_CONFIG_CHECKLIST.md)
  - Day-by-day instructions (DAY1_STARTUP_GUIDE.md)

  The formal BMM workflow process will help:
  - Ensure no critical planning steps are missed
  - Document decision-making at each phase
  - Support team coordination and handoffs
  - Provide clear progress tracking

  You can start development immediately while optional discovery
  workflows run in parallel.

  Status: Ready to begin prerequisite (document-project analysis)
  or jump directly to Day 1 implementation.
